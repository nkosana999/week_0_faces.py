# Making Faces
This is a python program that implements a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any ":)" converted to "🙂" and any ":(" converted to "🙁" while all other text is returned unchanged.

## Files
- 'faces.py': This is the main python script.
  The program is initiated by the "main()" functions which prompts the user for input then then calls the function that replaces the faces and then prints out the results.

## How To Run
- Make sure Python is installed to run the 'faces.py' file.
- In the terminal command: python faces.py
